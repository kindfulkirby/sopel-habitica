# habirc
[Sopel][1] IRC bot module for [Habitica][2]

The chosen unicode icons look best with [good emoji support][3].

Working so far:

* Echoes Habitica party chat into IRC
* Talk in chat from IRC
* .hero command displays character status
* Shows nick colors
* Disable colors (not recommended)

Planned Features:

* Cast spells from IRC
* Use Health potion from IRC
* Autoheal
* Some markdown parsing (code blocks!)

TODO:

* Tests
* Documentation

Maybe Features:

* Add Habits/Dailies/Todos
* Up/Down/Complete Habits/Dailies/Todos/Checklists
